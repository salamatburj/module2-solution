		<div>
			Approaches used for classification 
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Handling missing values and feature engineering based on historical purchases. Most features aggerated and filled on customer level. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Additional statistical features based such as entropy was implements to capture disorderness of buying behavior 
			</li>
			<li>
				Outliers contribution on error was very significant; therefore, another outlier detection model (binary classification) was developed           
			</li>
			<li>
				Regression models were trained on LightGBM together with Boruta algorithm for feature elimination 
			</li>
			<li>
				Final results were obtained by ensembling models with Bayesian Ridge Stacking
